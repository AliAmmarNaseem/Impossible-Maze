# Impossible Maze

The most difficult and frustrating game ever created. This HTML5 game is intentionally designed to be challenging and annoying.

## How to Play

1. Open `index.html` in your browser
2. Click the "Start Game" button
3. Use the arrow keys or WASD to navigate the blue player to the green goal
4. Try not to touch any red walls or obstacles
5. Try not to throw your computer out the window

## Features That Make It Frustrating

- **Random maze generation**: Each level has a different layout
- **Moving obstacles**: That actively try to hit you
- **Increasing difficulty**: Each level gets progressively harder
- **Fake mouse cursor**: From level 2, a fake cursor follows your real cursor
- **Screen inversion**: From level 3, the screen inverts colors when you die
- **Movement inertia**: From level 3, controls become less responsive
- **Auto-nudge**: From level 4, if you stay still too long, the game moves you slightly
- **Homing obstacles**: From level 4, obstacles subtly chase after you
- **Random movement resistance**: From level 5, controls become unpredictable

## Death Counter

The game keeps track of how many times you die. After 50 deaths, it's game over.
